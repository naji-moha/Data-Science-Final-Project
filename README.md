# Predicting Mental Health and Stress Levels from Lifestyle Data Using Machine Learning — Final Project

This project is all about using machine learning to predict stress levels based on people’s lifestyle habits. I used a Kaggle dataset that includes things like sleep, study hours, physical activity, screen time, and other daily routines. The idea is to see how these patterns relate to mental health and stress.

What this project does

Loads and cleans the dataset

Explores the data to understand relationships

Trains machine learning models to predict stress levels

Evaluates model performance

Saves the best model for future predictions

# Dataset

The dataset comes from Kaggle (by SHIO John). People filled out a self-reported survey with their lifestyle info and stress level. Each row is one person.

Main libraries used

pandas

numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

scikit-learn

# Mission
Use simple machine learning techniques to understand how lifestyle choices connect to stress — and build a model that can predict stress levels from those patterns.
